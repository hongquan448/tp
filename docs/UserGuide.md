## 1. Introduction

  OrgaNice! is a command line based application that can help academics with scheduling their tasks and keeping track of them.  Our application supports 2 types of tasks, they are as follows: 
 * **Deadline** Tasks - Used to denote a task that needs to be finished by a deadline.
    
     E.g, Assignments, Projects etc that are due on a specific date. 
 * **Event** Tasks - Used to denote an activity that happens over a period of time.
 
    E.g, Lectures, Tutorial sessions can be stored as events.
   
 The application can add, edit and delete tasks. It also provides methods to search for tasks. Additionally, it has the ability of storing data to a physical location on the computer, so that the tasks always remain in memory.  
    
 As a secondary feature, the application allows students who are in search of a study area to locate one based on different conditions. The different conditions that could be specified include the location, size constraints and port facilities.

   The current version of the application doesn't take into account the other tasks present, however the priority 
values can still be used to decide the task which is more important. In v3.0 our application will support scheduling tasks 
while avoiding tasks present previously and also add support for tasks to be scheduled preemptively (i.e, tasks can be 
scheduled over non contiguous days) .

__NOTE__: When using this format, flags must always come after the location, name or address. Else, the system will 
return an error message.

### Search by flags only 

Example of usage : 
`-s 6`

Expected output:

#### Future Enhancements

   The current implementation does not include real-time availability of the study areas. In version 3.0 we hope to be
   able to retrieve real-time availability of public study areas, like the ones in U-Town. In order to do so we would 
   require access to real-time data like CCTV monitors of the study areas to detect if there is an available seat at 
   a specific point of time at a specific area.

<a name="exit"></a>

### 3.14. Exit the Application / Study Area interface
You use this command to exit the application. Before the actual application is exited the 
tasks currently in the list are stored in a file. This command is used for exiting the main interface and the
secondary study area search interface.

#### Usage

#### `bye` - Exit the Application / Study Area interface

The command when issued performs an exit.
Upon success a successful message similar to the one in the example would appear and the application would be exited.
If the wrong format is used an invalid command alert would be displayed.

Example of usage: 
`bye`

Expected outcome:
Depending on the current mode of execution, the application would either be exited successfully or would return to the main interface.
A response similar to the following one would appear:
1) If the 'bye' command is given in the main interface

         Goodbye! Hope to see you again!

### 3.15. Saving the data
The tasklist is saved automatically before the application is executed. There is no need to save manually.

<a name="clear-old-tasks"></a>

### 3.16. Clearing old tasks
The tasklist only includes the tasks which have date beyond the current date. This removes the need for you to manually find and delete the old tasks.

<a name="calendar"></a>

### 3.17. Viewing tasks in calendar format [coming in v3.0]
The tasklist only includes the tasks which have date beyond the current date. This removes the need for you to manually find and delete the old tasks.

## 4. FAQ
    Q: How to transfer the task list data from one computer to an other computer?
    A: Just copy the "TaskList.txt" file which could be found at the same directory
       as the jar file and paste it to the location containing the jar file in the other
       computer. This should transfer the required data.
       
    Q: The software says that library/TaskList.txt does not exist. What do I do?
    A: Go to the software's root folder and check to see if the library folder exist. If so, delete the library folder 
       and rerun the software. The software would have created a fresh set of data files required for the system to run.
       
    Q: The software says that library/locations.txt or library/dictionary.txt does not exist. What do I do?
    A: Go to the software's root folder and check to see if the library folder exist. Proceed to check if TaskList.txt 
       exist. If so, transfer it to a temporary folder. Delete the library folder and rerun the software. Transfer the 
       content from the old TaskList.txt to the new TaskList.txt
